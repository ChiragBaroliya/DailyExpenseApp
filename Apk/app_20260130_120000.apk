PLACEHOLDER APK FILE

File name: app_20260130_120000.apk

This is a placeholder file created by the assistant because the execution environment cannot build a real Android APK (Android SDK / build tools not available).

How to produce a real APK locally:
1. Install Flutter and Android SDK on your Windows machine.
2. Ensure `ANDROID_HOME` (or `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`) is set and `platform-tools` are on PATH.
3. Run in PowerShell in the project root:
   flutter pub get
   flutter build apk --release
4. The produced APK will be at: build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk

To replace this placeholder with a real APK: build locally, then copy the real `app-release.apk` into this `Apk/` folder and commit.

If you want me to produce a real APK automatically, I can add a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and uploads the APK as an artifact on push or on tag. Reply which option you prefer.
