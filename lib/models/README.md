This folder is intended for plain Dart model classes shared across the app (if you prefer a `models/` layer instead of `data/models/`).

Current project keeps domain entities under `lib/domain/entities` and data models under `lib/data/models`.

Recommended usage:
- Use `models/` for DTOs or platform-specific models used directly by UI or services.
